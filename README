============

This represents an iterative overhaul of what used to be known as bBlog ( bblog.com ). The goals of this project are:

	* Drop support for PHP 4
	* Make PHP 5.3 compatible
	* Separate 3rd party code into cleanly defined area
	* Make compatible with suPHP ( and any other PHP handler that operates as a system user that is not Apache )
	* Remove all mixture of PHP + HTML ( except where it obviously makes sense )
	* More to be determined
